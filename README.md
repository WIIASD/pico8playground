# My PICO-8 Playground

Hey, this is my personal repository for my random PICO-8 mini projects

# What is PICO-8?

If you happened to be here by accident, you may wonder what is PICO-8.

In short, PICO-8 is a [fantasy console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_video_game_console) where people can make and play
8-bit style retro games. For more info, please visit [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)

# What's in here? 

Showcases of some of the stuff I have for now.

### Text Box

Control:
- x to change palette
